                    <hr>
                    <p style="color: black;">Jonathan Amaral is Indias's best PUBG mobile player. He is an esport player from India.
                        Jonathan is 19 years old. People know him because of his hacker like gameplay. Rather Jonathan does not use
                        any hack. Jonathan is one of the top PUBG player in the world. Jonathan is currently the most liked PUBG
                        mobile player in India with 800k Instagram follower and over 2.23M active subscriber on Youtube. If you
                        watch streams of PUBG Mobile players for improving your game-play, then you must have heard of TSM-Entity
                        Jonathan. He is a popular PUBG Mobile player who plays for TSM-Entity. Many players who have seen TSM-Entity
                        Jonathan's gameplay observe how good he is as an assaulter in PUBG Mobile. His full name is Jonathan Jude
                        Amaral, and he is based in Mumbai, India. His income is rumoured to be one lakh rupees per month
                        (approximately).</p>

                <h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">2. Zgod - TSM-Entity</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: whitesmoke;">Having dominated the Indian circuit in recent months, TSM-Entity are undoubtedly the top dogs in the circuit. The addition of Abhishek ‘ZGod’ Choudhary at the beginning of the season has helped the team improve on their performances and taken them to a new level of domination. Zgod isn’t just a prolific fragger but an insanely smart player as well, his ability to solo carry his team, especially if TSM take some early casualties, is second to none. One of the most dependable names in India, Zgod is a name who has a bright future ahead. Zgod’s ruthlessness and big brain plays in-game seems to be the polar opposite of his personality in real life, where he comes across as extremely jovial and good spirited. He was the 7th highest fragger in the PMPL South Asia League stage and in the recently concluded PMIS 2020 finals, he was awarded the Annihilator award for being the player with the most amount of damage.</p>

                <img id="vss3" src="mavi.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">3. Mavi - Orange Rock</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: whitesmoke;">Considered to be one of the smartest players in the region, Mavi is undoubtedly the best IGL in India at the moment. With a very high level understanding of the game, Mavi is able to lead his troops with incredible efficiency and effectiveness and is one of the key reasons behind Orange Rock’s rise to fame. He is also a really strong fragger who is able to almost always contribute along with calling the shots and planning ahead. Another strong suit in Mavi is the fact that his usage of utility is by far the best in the country and he has shown this very consistently. Individual skills aside, what seems to be the most redeeming factor about Mavi is that he will always play for the team and is never afraid to do the dirty work for his teammates. Whether it be in terms of scouting, playing risky angles, being the first one to go in or baiting for his team, Mavi is a leader who leads from the front. Mavi is a player who has a lot of potential. With new teammates arriving in the roster, he now has a stronger arsenal to
                work with and the upcoming World League will be a good test for Mavi and his boys, as they go up against the best of the
                best in the world.</p>

        <div class="app4" style="border-radius: 6px; background-color: rgb(3, 221, 185); margin: 20px;">
            <div style="border-radius: 6px; height: 200px; text-align: center; position: sticky;">
                <img id="vss4" src="seervi.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 style="color: black;">4. Seervi - SynerGE</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: black;">While he may not be the most popular name on the list, Seervi is one of the region’s most consistent performers. With a
                heap of raw talent and fragging power, Seervi also calls the game for his team and has slowly but surely developed into
                an incredibly well rounded player. He has helped transition his team to becoming a much more kill heavy play style and
                although the team has some trouble with placements and consistency, they have improved massively when it comes to
                fragging.
                
                Seervi placed 4th and 6th respectively in the PMPL South Asia League stage and finals and made one of the most memorable
                plays of the tournament when he clutched a 1v3 versus eventual champions, Celtz to win a chicken dinner. Seervi, along
                with SynerGE will be a part of the World League, and while their last international outing was not the most memorable,
                he will be hoping for a better showing, this time around.</p>

                <img id="vss5" src="owais.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 style="color: black;">5. Owais - Fnatic</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: black;">Despite a very mediocre season in terms of results, Owais remains one of the fan favorites in the country due to his
                long history and incredibly high skill level. A dependable figure in the team, Owais is not only the primary in-game
                leader for Fnatic but an exemplary performer who seems to always contribute with kills and assists. The arrival of
                Maxkash seems to be working for the squad as Fnatic’s second place finish at PMIS 2020 proved. Owais was the 5th highest
                fragger at PMIS.
                
                While Fnatic may not have qualified for the World League and will most likely be playing third party events for the next
                couple of months, fans of the player will be happy to know that Owais will be seen at World League, where he will be
                playing with Megastars. His experience and versatility will be extremely useful assets for the team and we can't wait to
                see what he is able to achieve with Megastars.</p>

                <h2 style="color: black;">6. Clutchgod - TSM-Entity</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: black;">Having come into the limelight after winning the PUBG MOBILE India Tour in 2019, Clutchgod has shown no signs of
                stopping. From SouL to TSM-Entity, the player has managed to make a place for himself everywhere and has only gotten
                better with the experience from past events. The in-game leader for TSM-Entity, Clutchgod not only enables his star
                players to go and frag out, but is also consistently on the charts himself. In fact, he was the top fragger in the PMPL
                South Asia Finals - true testament to his team’s aggressive kill heavy playstyle. It’s fair to say that he has one of
                the most difficult roles in the team and although it may not be the most apparent, he and Neyoo have to be the most
                versatile and adaptable players in the squad, while also contributing to the kills.</p>

                <img id="vss7" src="vexe.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">7. Vexe - Megastars</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: whitesmoke;">A rising star in the Indian PUBG Mobile community, Vexe is a young talent who has impressed everyone with his skills.
                One of the key members in the Megastars roster that has qualified for the World League, Vexe was the second highest
                fragger in the PMPL South Asia League stage. The young star is one of the hottest prospects in the region and with
                consistent fragging and good game sense, has managed to make a name for himself. In less than a week, he will be a part
                of the World League, where Megastars takes on some of the best teams and players in the world. That will be the biggest
                test in Vexe’s career up until now and it will be interesting to see whether the player can hold up in a high pressure
                environment.</p>

                <h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">8. GiLL - Orange Rock</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: whitesmoke;">Arshpreet ‘GiLL’ Singh was Godlike’s (now NovaGodlike) best performer in the PMPL and a crucial part of why the squad
                managed to qualify for the World League. While he has now joined Orange Rock alongside Mavi, Sc0utOP and Daljitsk, GiLL
                has managed to give everyone a glimpse of his famed skillset. He was the third highest highest fragger in the PMPL South
                Asia Finals and the 10th highest in the league stage. Fans can’t wait to see how he and his new superstar lineup are
                able to work together and how well they are able to represent India on a global stage. It is going to be his first major
                international tournament and GiLL seems to be the type of player who should be able to step up and shine, no matter what
                is put in front of him..</p>

                <h2 style="color: black;">9. Ted - SynerGE</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: black;">Ted joins the list in ninth position, with consistent high level performances in official and third party tournaments in
                recent months. The player was the third highest fragger in the PMPL South Asia league stage and is one of the few
                players in the Indian circuit, who has been around for such a long time. His experience and maturity will be invaluable
                to SynerGE in the World League and will hopefully make the difference in improving their performance from last season. An experienced player who brings a new depth to the squad</p>

                <h2 style="color: black;">10. Sc0utOP - Orange Rock</h2>
                <hr>
                <p style="color: black;">It has been a rocky season for Scout and Fnatic, but his recent move to Orange Rock may be the key to unlocking some new
                secrets. While we all know that he is an insanely talented player in the mid and long range, whether the super team will
                work is something that we are yet to find out. While Orange Rock had a very decent run till the semifinals stage at
                PMIS, they completely broke down in the finals. Of course a large part of this has to do with their IGL, Mavi having
                some issues with his health, but it was still disappointing for the fans. Everyone expects great things from Scout and
                while the player is always in the headlines, his trophy cabinet does feel a bit empty at the moment. Like everyone else
                on this list, he too will be in action at the World League, which kicks off at the end of this week.</p>
